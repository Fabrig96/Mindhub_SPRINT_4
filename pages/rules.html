          <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
          <p>
            The common interest that members of the Association share is to
            inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
            Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
            whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
            action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
            accomplishments or standing.

              <h3>DIMENSIONS</h3>
              <p>
                IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within
                a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions
                should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and
                older.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>COMPETITION FIELDS</h3>
              <p>
                Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of
                100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating
                in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the
                State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee
                to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
                waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
              </p>

                    Play on a field approximately 20 x 40 yards with no penalty
                    areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively
                    larger.

                  <p>
                    Fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                    dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.

          <h2>ALL-PLAY</h2>
          <p>
            All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play
            at least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition
            program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
          </p>

              A coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
              under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
              practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
              games, and injuries.
