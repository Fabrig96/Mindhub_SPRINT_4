              <h3>General Information</h3>
              <p>
                The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to
                provide athletes residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an
                environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a member of
                MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a
                Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by o small full-time
                staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and
                previous league members.
